The dashboard titled "Health-Care Analytics" presents various health-related metrics for a dataset of patients. Here's a summary and verification of each visual component:
Total Patients: The dashboard reports a total of 5191 patients, providing a baseline for all subsequent analyses.

High Moderate Health Risk Exercise < 30 min: It highlights that 859 patients have a high moderate health risk with less than 30 minutes of exercise, emphasizing the importance of physical activity.

Females with Healthy Weight: There are 1409 females reported to have a healthy weight, indicating a focus on gender-specific health metrics.

Habit of Smoking with High Health Risk: 37 patients are reported to have a habit of smoking coupled with a high health risk, underscoring the impact of smoking on health.

Percentage of Heart Attack: The pie chart indicates that 2.7% (approximately 0.1K out of 5.1K) of the patients have had a heart attack, highlighting cardiovascular health concerns.

Percentage of Stroke: Similarly, 1.7% (approximately 0.1K out of 5.1K) of the patients have experienced a stroke, further emphasizing cardiovascular risks.
Count of Overweight by Race: The bar graph shows the distribution of overweight patients by race, with Chinese at 4.0K, Malay at 0.6K, Indian at 0.4K, and Others at 0.1K, pointing to racial disparities in weight-related health issues.

Count of Health Risk by Age Group:

This bar graph shows the distribution of health risks across different age groups.
Age 40-49 has the highest count with 1.3K individuals, followed by age 50-59 with 1.1K.
The count decreases with age, with 0.5K in the 60-69 age group and only 0.2K in the 70+ age group.
This indicates that younger age groups (40-59) have higher health risks compared to older age groups.

Health Risk Statistics:

The graph categorizes the population into different health risk levels: normal, moderate high, high, and critical.
A majority of 3.1K individuals are at normal health risk.
1.6K are at moderate high risk, 0.4K at high risk, and a small fraction (0.1K) at critical risk.
This visualization helps in understanding the overall health risk distribution within the population.

Count of Health by Health:

This graph provides insights into the general health status of the population.
The majority, 3.3K individuals, report their health as good.
2.4K rate their health as very good, while only 0.5K consider their health not good, and 0.2K rate it as poor.
This suggests that a significant portion of the population perceives their health positively.
Count of Stress Levels Across Occupation:

This bar graph compares stress levels across different occupational categories.
Unemployed individuals and those in blue-collar jobs report higher levels of stress.
Individuals in white-collar jobs tend to manage stress better, with many reporting that they manage fairly well.

Insights and Patterns:
Stress and Employment Type: There's a noticeable trend where blue-collar jobs report the highest levels of stress, while white-collar job holders seem to manage stress better, with the highest proportion reporting that they manage fairly well.
Impact of Unemployment: Unemployment also correlates with higher stress levels, as indicated by the significant number of unemployed individuals reporting trouble with stress.
Variability in 'Others' and 'Unspecified': These categories show mixed results, suggesting a diverse range of jobs or conditions within these groups that could affect stress levels differently.
The graph provides a clear depiction of how occupation influences stress levels, with varying impacts across different job types.

These visuals collectively offer a comprehensive view of health risks, general health status, and stress levels, segmented by age and occupation, providing valuable insights for healthcare analysis and planning.
